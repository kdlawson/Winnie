Future home of a Python package focusing on PSF-subtraction and forward modeling of circumstellar disks in high-contrast imaging data. An initial release (~ early May 2024) will focus on JWST coronagraphic observations and will support RDI PSF-subtraction in various flavors, disk model convolution using synthetic PSF grids, and forward modeling for RDI.
