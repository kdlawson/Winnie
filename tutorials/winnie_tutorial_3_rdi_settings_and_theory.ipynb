    "\n",
    "This highlights a funny scenario that can emerge with similar data. If the coronagraph alignment of a particular science image is very well matched by one reference image, your stellar PSF model will likely be dominated by a single reference image. The alignment match will yield strong suppression of the stellar diffraction pattern and thus good sensitivity in the speckle-limited regime. However, the dominance of one reference image will result in a noisier stellar PSF model, thus potentially compromising the sensitivity in the background-limited regime. In other words, sensitivity at small separations can come at the price of sensitivity at larger separations. \n",
